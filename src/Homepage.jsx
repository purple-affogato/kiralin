            <h1>What is Kiralin</h1>
            <p>Kiralin is a site that allows users to assess how open and inclusive different companies are to women and nonbinary people. 
                This is a submission for the Women in STEM Hackathon hosted by The STEAM Boat and Code Her World. The goal of this 
                site is to make it easier for women and nonbinary people working in STEM to navigate industries where they're a minority. 
                You can get started by clicking the "Companies" tab in the header and searching for any company of your choosing!</p>
            <h1>How does Kiralin work</h1>
            <p>Using a combination of our own research and user polls, Kiralin offers users a wide range of data to help them 
                figure out which companies would be them as a women or nonbinary person. The research team (which is actually just one 
                person right now) provides information on each company's diversity policies and 
                representation in leadership. Users can share their experiences by answering polls about 
                their experiences working at certain companies. Kiralin's polls are focused on workplace culture, employee resource 
                groups, and feedback mechanisms. All user data is kept anonymous.</p>
